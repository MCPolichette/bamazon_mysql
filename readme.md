##Future of this project

Once I figured out connections, Things started to work much more smoothly.  I was crunched for time, and wish I had more time to finalize and flesh out this project.  I plan to complete the manager side and supervisor side, as this project has a lot of beneficial educational aspects and great learning experiences.
